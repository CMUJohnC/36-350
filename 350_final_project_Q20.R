cat("Hello intelligent extraterrestrials! If you're reading this, that is because Elon Musk would like to set up a colony on your planet. He's a businessman from Earth that doesn't make money, nor does he have any real intention for his businesses to ever become profitable. By some stroke of luck he consistently gets billions of dollars of funding for his pipe-dream projects because he can convince the public that whatever idea he's pitching is somehow worth wasting billions of dollars over. This colony he would like to set up on your exoplanet will probably never happen (just like his colony on Mars), but nonetheless if you respond back to this he will raise another trillion dollars to do whatever he wants. Musk has found a way to preserve his soul forever by using dark magic to split his soul into 7 horcrux's. Because of this, a prompt response from you all is not required but it is strongly encouraged. Elon Musk kindly requests that you respond back to this as soon as you can.")
